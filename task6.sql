-- The mobile operator runs a promotion. If you top up by at least â‚¬20 you get a free credit for 28
-- calendar days immediately following the day of that top up. Print out the list of consolidated periods
-- when users were eligible to make free calls. Include initial eligibility date and the date when the free
-- credit effectively ends.
-- Consider that with regular top-ups the free credit period may be effectively prolonged multiple times.
-- For instance for id_user=4 the first promotion period started on 2016-12-20 and with the four qualifying
-- topups being done on time it was effectively extended up until 2017-04-12:
